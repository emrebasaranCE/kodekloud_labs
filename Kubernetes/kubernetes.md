# Kubernetes – KodeKloud Labs

This section offers a practical introduction to **Kubernetes**, the leading container orchestration platform. Through these hands-on labs, you’ll learn how Kubernetes manages containerized applications at scale with high availability, scalability, and automation.

## ✅ Completed Kubernetes Labs

### ⚙️ Core Concepts
- **Familiarize Environment**  
  Get oriented with the Kubernetes environment, CLI tools (`kubectl`), and basic cluster components.

- **Pods**  
  Learn about Pods, the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes that encapsulate containers.

- **Replica Sets**  
  Ensure high availability by managing the number of pod replicas running at any given time.

- **Deployments**  
  Manage application rollout and lifecycle with declarative updates and version control.

- **Rolling Updates And Rollbacks**  
  Perform zero-downtime deployments and roll back to previous versions if needed.

- **Services**  
  Expose your applications to other pods and external users using ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer.

- **YAML**  
  Write declarative configuration files for Kubernetes objects using YAML syntax.
